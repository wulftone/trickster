# Trickster

Easy-to-use statistics for the card game called "bridge".

# Usage

Trickster has no dependencies.  Just include `trickster.js` in your webpage, then create a trickster object:

    var t = new Trickster('my-container-element-id');

It will create a sortable HTML table and put it into your container.  You are then free to style it however you wish.

# Example

See `index.html` in the example folder, or the [Trickster page](http://wulftone.github.io/trickster).  Click on the column headers to sort the rows.

# Upcoming

* More tables with more data!
* Multiple divs (containing tables) ready for Tabification (Ã  la jQuery UI or similar).
* Accessors for each table, so you can put each table exactly where you want it.
